(b) If at any time whilst the vessel is on hire under this charter the vessel fails to comply with the 79
requirements of Clauses 1, 2(a) or 10 then hire shall be reduced to the extent necessary to 80
indemnify Charterers for such failure. If and to the extent that such failure affects the time taken 81
by the vessel to perform any services under this charter, hire shall be reduced by an amount 82
equal to the value, calculated at the rate of hire, of the time so lost. 83
Any reduction of hire under this sub­Clause (b) shall be without prejudice to any other remedy 84
available to Charterers, but where such reduction of hire is in respect of time lost, such time 85
shall be excluded from any calculation under Clause 24. 86
(c) If Owners are in breach of their obligations under Clause 3(a)), Charterers may so notify Owners 87
in writing and if, after the expiry of 30 days following the receipt by Owners of any such notice, 88
Owners have failed to demonstrate to Charterers' reasonable satisfaction the exercise of due 89
diligence as required in Clause 3(a), the vessel shall be off­hire, and no further hire payments 90
shall be due, until Owners have so demonstrated that they are exercising such due diligence. 91

(c) Further and without prejudice to the foregoing, in the event of the vessel deviating (which 240
expression includes without limitation putting back, or putting into any port other than that to which she is bound 241
under the instructions of Charterers) for any cause or purpose mentioned in Clause 21 (a), the vessel shall be 242
off­hire from the commencement of such deviation until the time when she is again ready and in an efficient state 243
to resume her service from a position not less favourable to Charterers than that at which the deviation 244
commenced, provided, however, that any service given or distance made good by the vessel whilst so off­hire 245
shall be taken into account in assessing the amount to be deducted from hire. If the vessel, for any cause or 246
purpose mentioned in Clause 21 (a), puts into any port other than the port to which she is bound on the 247
instructions of Charterers, the port charges, pilotage and other expenses at such port shall be borne by Owners. 248
Should the vessel be driven into any port or anchorage by stress of weather hire shall continue to be due and 249
payable during any time lost thereby. 250
(d) If the vessel's flag state becomes engaged in hostilities, and Charterers in consequence of such 251
hostilities find it commercially impracticable to employ the vessel and have given Owners written notice thereof 252
then from the date of receipt by Owners of such notice until the termination of such commercial impracticability 253

(iii) If Owners are in breach of their obligation under Clause 3(i) Charterers may so notify Owners in 55
writing and if, after the expiry of 30 days following the receipt by Owners of any such notice, Owners have failed 56
to demonstrate to Charterers' reasonable satisfaction the exercise of due diligence as required in Clause 3(i), the 57
vessel shall be off­hire, and no further hire payments shall be due, until Owners have so demonstrated that they 58
are exercising such due diligence . 59
Furthermore, at any time while the vessel is off­hire under this Clause 3 Charterers have the 60
option to terminate this charter by giving notice in writing with effect from the date on which such notice of 61
termination is received by Owners or from any later date stated in such notice. This sub­Clause (iii) is without 62
prejudice to any rights of Charterers or obligations of Owners under this charter or otherwise (including without 63
limitation Charterers' rights under Clause 21 hereof). 64

and any subsequent amendments thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Clause 35, Charterers 69
may order the vessel to ice­bound waters or to any part of the world outside such limits provided that Owners 70
consent thereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) and that Charterers pay for any insurance 71
