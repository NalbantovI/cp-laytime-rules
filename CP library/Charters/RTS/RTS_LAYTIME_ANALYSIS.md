• In the event that there are surface coatings other than lime­wash is applied within the cargo
spaces, the nature of the coating should be ascertained, with particular attention being given to
those cargo spaces that have been freshly painted with metal oxide based paints. If the coating
could contaminate the cargo, the identity of the said coating will be recorded on the "Hold Inspection
Certificate" and the Company Shipping Officer will be advised immediately prior to the
commencement of loading.
• Cargo spaces must be free of scale, washed down with fresh or sea water, with a final wash of
fresh water. This is to be followed by a thick application of slaked line (Calcium Hydroxide Ca (OH)2)
to all surfaces that will come in contact with the cargo. The height of lime­washing within the holds
must represent at least 75% of the height of the bulkheads/sidewalls. Lime­washing must be
sufficiently thick to ensure that no bare metal or hold paint is visible through the lime coating. The
application of more than one coat of lime will usually be required in order to obtain a "Certificate of
Cleanliness" from the Surveyor.
• In the event that a vessel does not pass the above criteria then the Surveyor will not issue a
"Certificate of Cleanliness". Instead he will issue a "Hold Inspection Certificate" stating the condition
of the holds. Unless and until the Surveyor issues a "Certificate of Cleanliness" the Vessel will be
considered to have failed inspection and Notice of Readiness will not be accepted. All costs,
consequences and delays will be for Owner's account, until such time as the Surveyor passes the
Vessel and issues a "Certificate of Cleanliness" for it. The Vessel will be required to clean and re­
prepare holds as instructed by the Surveyor for re­presentation and must obtain a "Certificate of
