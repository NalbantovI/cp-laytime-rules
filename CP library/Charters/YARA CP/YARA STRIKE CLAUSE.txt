Good day Plamen.
 
This is what we have in the CP in regards to the Strike we had with mv Beaumaiden.
We have to count differently than we did in the LTC i think and not half time.


If there is a strike or lock-out affecting or preventing the actual discharging 
of the cargo on or after the Vessel’s arrival at or off port of discharge and same
has not been settled within 48 hours, the Charterers shall have the option of
keeping the Vessel waiting until such strike or lock-out is at an end against
paying half demurrage after expiration of the time provided for discharging
until the strike or lock-out terminates and thereafter full demurrage shall be
payable until the completion of discharging, 
 
15000 MTs  5000 Mts/day -> 72 hrs for discharging 
Arrive and tender NOR, strike announced, e.g. laytime commence at 14:00 -> accordingly after 72 hrs (time allowed for discharging) we count half-demurrage until 
strike's end is officially announced. Afterwards, we count full the demurrage until vessel is fully discharged.
