### Extract 1

```
5.4 If the berth nominated by the Charterer is not available, NOR may be tendered when the Vessel is anchored or drifting
safely at the place where vessels usually wait for the berth.
5.5 If the Vessel is later found not ready in all respects to commence cargo operations in accordance with this Clause 5, or is not
in free pratique or customs cleared in time to commence cargo operations then, without prejudice to the Charterer’s rights
under Clause 4, any previously tendered NOR shall be deemed null and void. For the avoidance of doubt, no laytime or time
on demurrage shall have accrued, or shall accrue in the time thereby lost and the Vessel shall re‐tender NOR once ready.
Any expenses directly attributable to the tender of the invalid NOR, including without limitation, standby costs of shore
labour, trucks and other equipment shall be for the Owner’s account.
6. COMMENCEMENT OF LAYTIME
6.1 Once valid NOR has been tendered and accepted by the Charterer, laytime (or time on demurrage) for loading/discharging
shall commence:
(a) where turn time, is stated in BOX 12 for loading and/or BOX 13 for discharging, on the expiry of the turn time; or
(b) where a time of a day is stated in BOX 12 for loading and/or BOX 13 for discharging for the commencement of
laytime, at that time on such a day; and
(c) where nothing is stated in BOX 12 for loading and/or BOX 13 for discharging, 12 hours from tendering of the NOR.
6.2 One half of any time used for cargo operations before commencement of laytime as above shall count as laytime or time on
demurrage.
7. LOADING AND DISCHARGING
7.1 The Owner shall determine, check and ensure that the Owner and the Vessel satisfy and comply with any restrictions and/or
applicable regulations and rules in force at the loading and discharging ports.
