2) Laytime shall in no event commence on a Saturday, Sunday, stevedoring holiday or during any overtime period regard­ 177
less of the commencement of discharge. 178
3) If Vessel is ready to proceed to discharging berth and Charterer does not issue docking orders, or cannot provide a berth, 179
laytime shall commence at the beginning of the next regular working period after notice of readiness by Owner to Charterer and 180
after allowance of normal transit time from quarantine to discharging berth. All subsequent time (which otherwise would be 181
working time) lost shall count as laytime. However, any such time used by Owner for loading or discharging cargo not covered 182

4) Any time (which otherwise would be working time) lost by failure of Vessel to reach discharging berth in accordance 184
with docking orders shall not count as laytime and Vessel shall pay for any stand­by time of labor incurred by reason of failure 185
of Vessel to arrive at berth at designated time. 186

consents, then Owner may dispatch the vessel as proposed, but Charterer shall not be liable for dead freight on cargo which has not 202
been loaded up to the time of commencement of the hindrance. If Charterer does not consent, Owner shall not dispatch the Vessel as 203
proposed, but such suspension of laytime because of such hindrance shall not continue beyond 24 hours after Charterer received such 204
notice. 205
(b) Laytime for discharging shall not commence, or if commenced shall be suspended during any period in which the issuance of 206
docking orders, berthing of the Vessel, or discharging is prevented or delayed by any strike, work stoppage or other labor dispute 207
except (1) a strike or work stoppage of labor employed by the Receiver in any capacity other than as stevedore for discharging such 208
cargo, or (2) a strike or work stoppage of labor ordinarily engaged in operating Vessel or discharging its cargo which is solely in 209
sympathy with a then existing strike or work stoppage by labor employed by (a) the Receiver of Vessel's cargo acting in any capa­ 210
city other than as stevedore for discharging such cargo or (b) the Receiver of the sugar cargo of some other vessel acting in any 211
capacity other than as stevedore for discharging such cargo. A strike, work stoppage or other labor dispute shall be deemed to be in 212
effect and to prevent or delay discharging during any period in which (1) after the berthing of the vessel at Receiver's berth, its dis­ 213
charge is not commenced or continued because of the refusal or failure of labor to perform such discharge, or (2) prior to the berthing 214
of the vessel, its berthing or discharge in the berth to which it normally would be assigned is prevented or delayed because of the 215
refusal or failure of labor to work on the discharge of some other vessel occupying such berth, (3) prior to the berthing of the vessel, 216
a strike of maritime labor on or against other similar vessels makes it probable that its berthing or discharge would cause picketing 217
or other labor trouble at the berth to which it would be assigned, or (4) prior to or after the berthing of the vessel, its berthing or dis­ 218
charge in the berth to which it normally would be assigned is prevented or delayed as a result of any decision, direction or request of 219
any duly constituted association of ship operators and others in the discharging port, including but not limited to any decision, direc­ 220
tion or request intended to enforce or induce longshore or other maritime labor to comply with the provisions of any applicable labor 221

effect and to prevent or delay discharging during any period in which (1) after the berthing of the vessel at Receiver's berth, its dis­ 213
charge is not commenced or continued because of the refusal or failure of labor to perform such discharge, or (2) prior to the berthing 214
of the vessel, its berthing or discharge in the berth to which it normally would be assigned is prevented or delayed because of the 215
refusal or failure of labor to work on the discharge of some other vessel occupying such berth, (3) prior to the berthing of the vessel, 216
a strike of maritime labor on or against other similar vessels makes it probable that its berthing or discharge would cause picketing 217
or other labor trouble at the berth to which it would be assigned, or (4) prior to or after the berthing of the vessel, its berthing or dis­ 218
charge in the berth to which it normally would be assigned is prevented or delayed as a result of any decision, direction or request of 219
any duly constituted association of ship operators and others in the discharging port, including but not limited to any decision, direc­ 220
tion or request intended to enforce or induce longshore or other maritime labor to comply with the provisions of any applicable labor 221
contract. 222

be limited to such demurrage as may be due hereunder. 224
