### Extract 1

```
Shippers or any competent official body or authority or as agreed between Owner and Shippers and the Master warrants that the Vessel is physically ready in all 89
respects to load, the time spent waiting at a usual waiting place outside the commercial limits of the port or off the port shall count against laytime. 90
Such laytime shall count from Vessel's arrival at such usual waiting place (subject to Masters written or telegraphic notice of arrival being given to Shippers) and will 91
continue to run as per Clause 10 until any of the aforesaid conditions cease to be operative and Vessel is so notified by Shippers or their Agents or any competent 92
authority. 93
If after entering the commercial limits of the loading port, Vessel fails to pass inspections as per Clause 9 and requires more than four hours Saturdays, Sundays and 94
Holidays included to pass such inspections from the times of initial failure to pass, the time spent waiting outside the commercial limits of the port as per lines 91, 92 95
93, shall not count and the provisions of lines 101,102 are not to apply, but, if said Vessel passes inspections within the said four hours, any delay in commencing 96
loading directly attributable to its failure to pass initial inspections shall not count as laytime or time on demurrage. 97
Time so used is to be added to laytime (or time on demurrage) used for loading the entire cargo. 98
Once the Vessel has reached a place within the commercial limits of the port, notice of readiness is to be tendered and laytime is to begin to count in accordance with 99
the provisions of lines 76­79. 100
At first or sole loading port the cancelling date shall be extended by the number of running days Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays included rounded to the nearest day 101
spent waiting outside the commercial limits of the port for berth (in accordance with the provisions of lines 88 ­ 89). 102
In the event that the Vessel is waiting for loading berth, no laytime is to be deducted during such period for reasons of weather unless the Vessel occupying the loading 103
berth in question is actually prevented from working grain due to weather conditions in which case time so lost is not to count unless the Vessel is on demurrage. 104
Time occupied in moving from place of waiting to loading berth shall not count as laytime. 105
Should the Port Authority at the loading port order that the Vessel be loaded during overtime hours, (including Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays) then additional costs 106
are to be borne 50% by the Owners of the Vessel, and 50% by the Shippers, except officer's and crew's overtime which shall be for Owner's account. 107
Owners guarantee Vessel is fully fitted in accordance with Australian Regulations that may be in force during the duration of this Charterparty including hold ladder 108

the
Vessel shall not pay overtime for work which in ordinary working hours is performed by the Shippers. In such case all additional stevedoring costs incurred as a result 113
working outside working hours shall be for Shippers' accounts.
Shipowners undertake not to exceed a maximum deepest draft (i.e. the draft at the deepest point of the vessel) of salt water 114
during loading and/or completion at loading port(s), but in the event of the Master requesting to exceed this draft it is mutually agreed that the Shippers may at their 115
discretion accede to the Master's request, provided it is at the Owners' risk and responsibility and that all other conditions of the Charterparty are not varied in any 116
way, particularly the maximum draft at the discharging port(s) if applicable. 117
