(d) If discharge cannot be undertaken or must cease solely due to bad weather, such interruption to
discharge shall not be counted as laytime. When weather permits discharge, laytime shall resume.
(e) When discharge is delayed or suspended due to any fault not attributable to Charterers, including but
not limited to the Owner’s fault and/or negligence, the Vessel’s, captain’s, or crew member’s fault
and/or negligence, it shall not be counted as laytime, even if the Vessel is already on demurrage.
(f) The time lost waiting for berth shall be counted as laytime. The first shifting time from the anchorage
to the discharge berth shall be counted as laytime, even if the Vessel is already on demurrage.
Shifting time and expenses from berth to berth/anchorage shall be borne by the Party who has made
the specific request concerned.
(g) The Charterers may order the Vessel to move from one safe berth to another safe berth/anchorage or
from one wharf to another wharf. If the Vessel moves due to the Charterers’ needs, the Charterers
shall bear the shifting expenses, and the shifting time shall be added to laytime. However, if the
Vessel moves due to the mutual needs of the Charterers and the Owners, the Parties shall mutually
agree as to how the expenses will be borne and whether the shifting time will be added to laytime.
(h) When discharge is suspended at the Owners’ request, it shall not be counted as laytime, even if the
Vessel is already on demurrage.
(i) Subject to this paragraph ⑥ and other applicable provisions of this Contract, once the Vessel is on
demurrage, the Vessel is always on demurrage. The Charterers shall not, however, be liable for any
demurrage for delay cause by the Owner, Vessel, or its crew, including but not limited to strike,
lockout, stoppage or restraint of labor for Master, officers and crew of the Vessel.
