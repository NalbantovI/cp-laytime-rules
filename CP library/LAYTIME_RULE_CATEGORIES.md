## IDENTIFICATION METHODOLOGY

### How to Categorize a Clause:

1. **Read the full clause** including context
2. **Identify the trigger event** (what causes the rule to apply)
3. **Determine the consequence** (does time count, not count, count at different rate?)
4. **Look for keywords** from the categories above
5. **Consider the responsible party** (Owner, Charterer, third party, force majeure)
6. **Apply primary and secondary categories** (clauses may fit multiple categories)

### Multi-Category Rules:

Many clauses may fall under multiple categories. Apply all relevant tags.

**Example:**
```
"If stevedores not permitted to work due to failure of Master to comply with regulations,
time so lost shall not count as laytime, even if Vessel is on demurrage"
```

**Categories:**
- Primary: 4.4 Vessel Compliance/Certification
- Secondary: 12.1 "Even if on Demurrage" Clauses
- Related: 7.2 Authorities/Regulations
