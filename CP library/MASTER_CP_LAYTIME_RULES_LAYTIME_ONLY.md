Laytime for discharging shall not commence, or if commenced shall be suspended during any period

(1) a strike or work stoppage of labor employed by the Receiver in any capacity other than as 
stevedore for discharging such cargo, or 
(2) a strike or work stoppage of labor ordinarily engaged in operating Vessel or discharging its 
cargo which is solely in sympathy with a then existing strike or work stoppage by labor employed 
by the Receiver of Vessel's cargo or the Receiver of the sugar cargo of some other vessel (acting 
in any capacity other than as stevedore for discharging such cargo).

A strike, work stoppage or other labor dispute shall be deemed to be in effect and to prevent or 
delay discharging during any period in which:
(1) after the berthing of the vessel at Receiver's berth, its discharge is not commenced or 
continued because of the refusal or failure of labor to perform such discharge, or 
(2) prior to the berthing of the vessel, its berthing or discharge in the berth to which it normally 
would be assigned is prevented or delayed because of the refusal or failure of labor to work on 
the discharge of some other vessel occupying such berth, 
(3) prior to the berthing of the vessel, a strike of maritime labor on or against other similar 
vessels makes it probable that its berthing or discharge would cause picketing or other labor 
trouble at the berth to which it would be assigned, or 
(4) prior to or after the berthing of the vessel, its berthing or discharge in the berth to which 
it normally would be assigned is prevented or delayed as a result of any decision, direction or 
request of any duly constituted association of ship operators and others in the discharging port,

longshore or other maritime labor to comply with the provisions of any applicable labor.
